    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Gabriel Tenorio, a self-taught tech innovator specializing in AI integration and intelligent automation solutions. I focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems, transforming traditional workflows into smart, efficient systems. While others theorize about AI's potential, I'm building intelligent solutions that workâ€”combining cutting-edge technology with real-world engineering to create systems that actually deliver.</p>
    <p>Beyond software, I bring extensive hands-on expertise across multiple domains: from troubleshooting small 2- and 4-stroke engines to electrical systems and plumbing, from circuit design and microelectronics to precision soldering and microcontroller programming. My technical foundation spans construction and drywall work, fine woodworking and custom furniture design, plus comprehensive computer rebuilds covering hardware, software, operating systems, and cybersecurity. This diverse engineering background allows me to approach AI projects with a deep understanding of how digital intelligence integrates with physical systems.</p>
    <p>As a successful nature photographer, I combine artistic vision with technical precision, capturing the wild's beauty through both lens and code. My professional journey includes leading sales teams at Kay Jewelers (managing $1.5M annual revenue, hiring and training staff), and founding VividSight as an entrepreneur, handling everything from budgets to marketing. This results-driven background in management, team leadership, and customer relations perfectly complements my technical AI pursuits, enabling me to deliver intelligent solutions that create lasting value and transform how businesses operate.</p>
